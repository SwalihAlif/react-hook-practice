# React Hook Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering React Hooks. It includes various implementations, examples, and exercises covering fundamental and advanced React Hooks.

## Hooks Covered
### **Fundamental Hooks**
- `useState` – Manage state within a functional component.
- `useEffect` – Handle side effects, API calls, and lifecycle methods.
- `useRef` – Access and persist references without re-renders.

### **Intermediate Hooks**
- `useContext` – Global state management without prop drilling.
- `useReducer` – Alternative to `useState`, useful for managing complex state logic.
- `useCallback` – Optimize functions by memoizing them to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- `useMemo` – Memoize values to improve performance.
- `React.memo` – Prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components.

### **Advanced Hooks**
- `useLayoutEffect` – Similar to `useEffect` but runs synchronously after DOM mutations.
- `useImperativeHandle` – Customize the instance value exposed when using `forwardRef`.
